In case you are falling short of funds in your account the deficit will be withdrawn from your Fixed Deposit so that you can enjoy financial peace of mind and live worry-free.  What is more; the fixed deposit thus created does not carry any pre-closure/part closure penalty which is usually 0.5% to 1%; you save on that too. \nIllustration:\nLet’s say you have a Kotak Edge Savings Account and you opt for the ActivMoney facility.\nThe default ActivMoney threshold for your savings account is Rs.25, 000.\nNow in case your savings account balance is more than the threshold of Rs.25,000 at the end of the day, the excess amount will automatically get transferred in multiples of Rs.5,000* to a 180 day FD. You will then earn the prevailing FD rate on the balance that has been transferred to the FD. As this FD is linked to your savings account, you can access the funds whenever you wish to, with no penalty charges.\nIn case you are falling short of funds in your savings account, you need not worry as the deficit will be withdrawn from your FD automatically\nWhile there is nil penalty on premature withdrawal as contracted tenor of FD is 180 days, very early premature withdrawal like 45 days or before at times may result in interest earnings on FD lower than savings bank account interest\n\n \n \nSummary of account balance at the end of the day\n\n \n \nSavings/ Current Account balance\n\nFixed deposit balance\n\nTotal Available balance\n\nDay1\n \n\nYou have a balance of Rs.1 lakh in your account with the defined threshold (minimum amount to stay in your Savings account) of Rs.25, 000.  At the end of the day, Rs. 75,000 is moved to an auto-created fixed deposit of 180 days at the prevailing rate of 7%. \n\nOpening balance\n1,00,000\n \nEnd of the day\n25,000\n\n \n0\n \n \n75,000-Dep1\n\n \n1,00,000\n \n \n1,00,000\n\nDay 2\n\nCredited another Rs.25,000 in account\n\nOpening Balance\n25,000\n \nEnd of day Balance\n25, 000\n\n75,000 – Dep1\n25,000 -Dep2\n\n1,25,000\n\nDay 17\n\nCheque for Rs.40,000 presented in clearing\n\nOpening Balance 25,000\n \nEnd of day Balance\n25,000\n\n60,000-Dep1*\nDep2-liquidated*\n\n   85,000\n\n\n*FDs will be created and broken in multiples of ₹5,000 for new ActivMoney registrations w.e.f 5th July’23.

Dep2 will earn interest for 15 days at the applicable rate without penalty (on LIFO basis) as it exceeds 7 days which is minimum period required to be eligible for interest and Rs.10000 liquidated from Dep1 would earn eligible interest for 16 days.

Since the market value of securities changes every day, the NAV of a scheme also varies on a day-to-day basis.

For example, if the total market value of securities of a mutual fund scheme is Rs. 210 lakh, its liabilities are Rs. 10 lakh, and the mutual fund has issued 10 lakh units to investors, its NAV per unit will be Rs. 20 ie ; Rs 210 lakh minus Rs 10 lakh divided by 10 lakh units.",

Beneficiary can write to Kotak Life Insurance claims department and Claims department would put the matter before internal ombudsman for resolution. The decision taken by internal ombudsman would be communicated to the beneficiary. Beneficiary can also get in touch with Life Insurance Ombudsman (list of Ombudsman is available with Kotak Life Insurance and can be provided on request). \nClaims under unusual events: \n\nMissing Person \nAny person, whose whereabouts are unknown whatever be the circumstances or causes of disappearance would fall under this category. Such person/s shall be considered as \"MISSING\" until located and their well-being or otherwise being duly established. In the normal process of life insurance claim settlement, filing an insurance claim without a death certificate can create problems. In this connection, we shall follow provisions of Sec. 108 of the Indian Evidence.\nAct and a Supreme Court ruling, which are as under: \nProvisions of Section 108 of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872: \nBurden of proving that person is alive who has not been heard of for seven years: \nProvided that when the question is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is proved that he has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it.The Supreme Court Ruling is based on the provisions of Section-108 and states that \"The presumption as to death in the absence of any evidence would arise only on lapse of seven (7) years\". In other words, it would mean that a missing person is not presumed dead until he or she has been missing for seven years. Thus the presumption of death of the Life Insured shall be taken into account only on completion of 7 years from the date of the person having gone missing. Moreover, this has to be by way of an order from a competent authority/court. The date of order of such authority/court shall be considered as the date of death. \nUnforeseen Circumstances / Natural Calamities: \nThe company shall look at cases of natural disasters or one-off major incidences like Tsunami, Mumbai Floods, 9-11 attacks etc., on an exception basis. We shall make basic checks/enquiries to ensure that there are no mal-practices, invalid claims are not being incorrectly honored by the Company or benefits are not unfairly/wrongly paid to third persons, not fairly eligible for the claims against the interests of the Policyholders at large. Based on these sanity checks, the company shall waive certain documentation to ensure a smooth claims process for the benefit of the Policyholders at large. \nBased on a Death Certificate issued by the Municipal Authorities or equivalent or based on a typical statistics/gazette issued by the State/Central Govt., claims can be processed on the presumption that the Life Insured has expired, irrespective of other documentation. \nAn indemnity may be collected from the nominee in each case. \nIn all cases, we would need complete documentary evidence of the relationship of the nominee/legal heir.",
